# Congressional Asian Pacific American Staff Association

We are a non-partisan congressional staff organization designed to provide you with opportunities to meet other Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders on Capitol Hill through professional development seminars, social networking events, and more.

Our website is under development. We promise to be back up and running soon. In the meantime, please check out our upcoming events on our social media accounts. 

For general inquiries, please contact us at capasa.info@gmail.com. For membership inquiries, please contact Kelvin Lum (kelvin.lum@mail.house.gov).
