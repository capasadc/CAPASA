## Who We Are

We are a non-partisan congressional staff organization designed to provide you with opportunities to meet other Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders on Capitol Hill through professional development seminars, social networking events, and more. Read more about the board [here](board.html).

Dues are $15 for permanent Hill staff and free for interns, fellows, and detailees. These funds allow us to put on great events throughout the year. Also, members will be the first people to have access to invitations and unique opportunities. 

If you are experiencing financial challenges, please do not hesitate to reach out to any member of the board, or specifically our treasurer, Kelvin Lum at kelvin.lum@mail.house.gov. You can also send questions about your membership status to CAPASA@mail.house.gov.
