SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT: During these troubling times, we recognize that many in our community may be experiencing hardship. Our mission has always been to be a resource and an ally to the AAPI community on the Hill. To stand by our community, the CAPASA Board has voted to not implement our new membership dues structure this year, and maintain our old model. This means that instead of increasing membership dues to $15, we will keep them at $10 for permanent Hill staff and free for interns, fellows, and detailees for 2020. If you are experiencing financial challenges, please do not hesitate to reach out to any member of the board, or specifically our treasurer, Kelvin Lum at kelvin.lum@mail.house.gov. You can also send questions about your membership status to CAPASA@mail.house.gov.

Dues are only $10 a year and these funds allow us to put on great events throughout the year. Also, members will be the first people to have access to invitations and unique opportunities the staff association is approached about.
